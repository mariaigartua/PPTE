## Binary Data

Hyperlinks were labeled to indicate whether or not they were opt-out links. See
the file `binary_example.py` for details about how to access these labels. This
script requries [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org). We tested it with
version 1.3.16 of SQLAlchemy. You can see all available fields defined in our
database schema in the file `binary_data/models.py`. If you prefer not to use
Python and SQLAlchemy, you can explore the database by opening the file
`binary_data/policies.db` with
[DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org).

## Category Data

Opt-Out hyperlinks were labeled to indicate the category of data involved. See
the file `category_example.py` for details about these labels.
